# Changes to original answers
Students' queries should be slightly modified so that the following errors are ignored:
- capitalization ("BEVANDE" vs "bevande", since it's not specified in the query request)
- spaces ("id cat" vs "idcat") - this is most likely caused by the OCR software, since the answers were handwritten
- typos for similar characters (e.g. "0" instead of "O") - be particularly careful, since for some reasons we have two different character encodings for "Ã "

# Notes
- Several students used "do" as an alias - do is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as an alias, unless included between quotation marks. Students most likely are not aware of this specific scenario, so it is reasonable to ignore this error (by renaming it to something else so that the query can execute).
